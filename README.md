What happens in the brain when a rat runs through a maze?
Deep inside the hippocampus — a brain region that helps animals (and humans!) remember places and make decisions— special waves called theta oscillations appear.
These brain rhythms, in the 5–10 Hz range, show up when the animal is active, alert, and exploring.
Using LFP recordings from electrodes placed directly in the rat’s brain, we can observe these oscillations in real time and explore how they relate to behavior.

We analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the hippocampus of a freely moving rat . 
The data included periods of sleep and active running. 
We focused on detecting and analyzing theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) during running. 
Signal processing was performed in MATLAB using standard spectral analysis methods.
We compared theta properties across hippocampal layers and examined they relation to running speed of the animal.
